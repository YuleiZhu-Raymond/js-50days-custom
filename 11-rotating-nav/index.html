            <h1>Zero Two - Darling in the Franxx</h1>
            <small>Code: 002</small>
            <p>
                Zero Two is the mysterious and elite pilot from the anime <strong>Darling in the Franxx</strong>. Known by her codename
                002, she possesses pink hair, red horns, and a striking presence. Dubbed the "Partner Killer", her co-pilots rarely
                survive more than three rides. Her FRANXX unit is Strelizia, which she pilots with Hiro (Code: 016), whom she
                affectionately calls "Darling".
            </p>
